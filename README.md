# CTRL-Core

Developers need a way not only to create, but to collaborate and share what they've created with others. We want to create a MERN-stack application that allows these developers to contribute to an online community in which users can share their portfolios, relevant links to projects they are working on, and receive feedback in the process.

Fundamentally, a user can view some portfolios, but in order to contribute, one must log in first and create a sessions with web tokens in order to upload portoflios, links, screenshots, or comments on the work of other users. A secondary goal we could implement would in fact be the ability to upload these screenshots (if we can establish that functionality for the app), as well as a possible donation system utilizing Stripe. We also would like to implement styling with the help of Chakra UI.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
